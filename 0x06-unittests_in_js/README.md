# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Description

This directory contains projects and tasks focused on unit testing in JavaScript. These tasks aim to teach you how to write effective unit tests using popular testing frameworks like Mocha and assertion libraries like Chai. You will learn how to create test suites, use spies and stubs, handle asynchronous tests, and write integration tests for your Node.js applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the importance and principles of unit testing
- Set up a testing environment using Mocha and Chai
- Write and run test cases using Mocha
- Use assertion libraries to validate test outcomes
- Implement spies and stubs to isolate and test specific functionality
- Use hooks to manage test setup and teardown
- Write unit tests for asynchronous functions
- Create integration tests for small Node.js servers

## Files

- `0-calcul.js`: Simple calculator functions to be tested.
- `0-calcul.test.js`: Unit tests for the calculator functions.
- `1-assert.js`: Script demonstrating basic assertions using Node's assert module.
- `2-mocha.js`: Simple Mocha test suite.
- `3-chai.js`: Example of using Chai for assertions.
- `4-hooks.js`: Demonstration of using hooks in Mocha.
- `5-spies.js`: Example of using spies in tests.
- `6-stubs.js`: Example of using stubs in tests.
- `7-async.js`: Testing asynchronous functions.
- `8-integration.js`: Integration tests for a small Node.js server.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- Mocha and Chai installed globally or locally in your project
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js
