# 0x04-TypeScript

This project is focused on learning and applying TypeScript in various scenarios. TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, adds static types to the language, allowing for better tooling, error checking, and developer productivity. Throughout this project, we will explore basic to advanced TypeScript features, including types, interfaces, classes, and generics. The goal is to understand how TypeScript improves JavaScript codebases by making them more robust and maintainable.

In addition to the core TypeScript concepts, we will also cover topics such as modules, decorators, async/await, and more. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of TypeScript and be able to confidently use it in your own projects.

To get started, make sure you have TypeScript installed on your machine. You can do this by running `npm install -g typescript` in your terminal. Once installed, you can create a new TypeScript file by using the `.ts` extension.

Throughout the project, we will provide code examples and exercises to reinforce your learning. Feel free to experiment and modify the code to see how TypeScript behaves in different scenarios.

We hope you find this project informative and enjoyable. Happy coding with TypeScript!
