# 0x02-ES6_classes

Welcome to the **0x02-ES6_classes** directory! This section of the repository is dedicated to exploring and practicing the class syntax introduced in ES6, which provides a more intuitive and structured way to work with objects and inheritance in JavaScript.

## Overview

In this directory, you will learn about ES6 classes and how they bring object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to JavaScript. Topics covered include:

- **Class Syntax**: Understanding the basic structure and syntax of ES6 classes.
- **Constructors**: Defining and using constructors for class instantiation.
- **Instance Methods**: Creating methods that belong to class instances.
- **Static Methods**: Defining methods that belong to the class itself.
- **Inheritance**: Implementing inheritance using the `extends` keyword.
- **Super Keyword**: Utilizing the `super` keyword to call parent class constructors and methods.
- **Getters and Setters**: Using getters and setters to control access to object properties.
- **Encapsulation**: Implementing encapsulation to protect class properties and methods.

## Contents

This directory includes a series of exercises and examples to help you master ES6 classes:

1. **0-classroom.js**: Introduction to creating a basic class.
2. **1-constructor.js**: Using constructors to initialize class instances.
3. **2-methods.js**: Adding instance methods to a class.
4. **3-static.js**: Defining and using static methods.
5. **4-inheritance.js**: Implementing inheritance with the `extends` keyword.
6. **5-super.js**: Using the `super` keyword to access parent class methods.
7. **6-getters-setters.js**: Creating getters and setters for class properties.
8. **7-encapsulation.js**: Implementing encapsulation to protect data within a class.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this directory:

1. Navigate to the `0x02-ES6_classes` directory:
   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x02-ES6_classes
   ```
2. Open the JavaScript files to explore the examples and complete the exercises.
