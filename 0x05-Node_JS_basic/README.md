# 0x05. Node.js Basics

## Description

This directory contains projects and tasks aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of Node.js. These tasks cover the basics of Node.js, including its architecture, core modules, and essential features. By working through these tasks, you'll gain a solid foundation in Node.js and be well-equipped to build and manage server-side applications using this powerful runtime environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of Node.js and its core modules
- Use the built-in `http` module to create and manage a web server
- Handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await
- Work with file system operations using the `fs` module
- Use `process` and `os` modules for system-level operations
- Implement basic error handling techniques
- Build and run simple Node.js scripts and applications

## Files

- `0-console.js`: Script that prints a message to the console using `console.log`.
- `1-stdin.js`: Script that reads input from the standard input (stdin) and prints it to the console.
- `2-args.js`: Script that prints the arguments passed to it.
- `3-read_file.js`: Script that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
- `4-http.js`: Script that creates a simple HTTP server using the `http` module.
- `5-http_get.js`: Script that makes a GET request to a specified URL and prints the response.
- `6-http_post.js`: Script that makes a POST request to a specified URL and prints the response.
- `7-timeout.js`: Script that demonstrates the use of `setTimeout` for asynchronous operations.
- `8-async_await.js`: Script that uses async/await to handle asynchronous operations.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Familiarity with command line operations
